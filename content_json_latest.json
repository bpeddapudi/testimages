The company has annualised revenues of circa £375 million, over 6,500 customers, and more than 2,200 employees. \r\n\r\nThe company’s ambitious growth strategy has led to numerous acquisitions. On a constant currency basis, revenues have increased four times in under five years and Claranet consistently appears in The Sunday Times Top Track 250 as one of the fastest growing privately-owned businesses in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis international success is driven by local service, out of local offices, using a mixture of local and international infrastructure, including public clouds. \r\n\r\nClaranet is positioned in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Data Centre Outsourcing and Hybrid Infrastructure Managed Services, Europe, introduced this year. This follows Claranet’s inclusion as a ‘Leader’ in the Magic Quadrant for Managed Hybrid Cloud Hosting, Europe for five years since, 2013..",

Whilst doing that it also provides a platform to reduce the cost for your Remote Access Workers.\r\n\r\nSecondly it reduces the costs associated with your future requirements. These are not limited to just the savings afforded against secure connectivity but the ability to expedite your time to market, to reach ecosystems as you need them and take services that become available with immediate effect.\r\n\r\nThirdly it provides a flexibility of choice and change against other connectivity requirements your organisation has. This means that you can still consume MPLS services, internet connected services or that which your organisation needs, but with the ability to have multiple providers that you can switch on or off as you need. This improves options for Business Continuity as well as protecting your business against large contractual tie-ins.\r\n\r\nFinally it provides an opportunity for revenue generation by collating considerable amounts of meta-data at a very granular level.

Whilst doing that it also provides a platform to reduce the cost for your Remote Access Workers.\r\n\r\nSecondly it reduces the costs associated with your future requirements. These are not limited to just the savings afforded against secure connectivity but the ability to expedite your time to market, to reach ecosystems as you need them and take services that become available with immediate effect.\r\n\r\nThirdly it provides a flexibility of choice and change against other connectivity requirements your organisation has. This means that you can still consume MPLS services, internet connected services or that which your organisation needs, but with the ability to have multiple providers that you can switch on or off as you need. This improves options for Business Continuity as well as protecting your business against large contractual tie-ins.\r\n\r\nFinally it provides an opportunity for revenue generation by collating considerable amounts of meta-data at a very granular level.

Whilst doing that it also provides a platform to reduce the cost for your Remote Access Workers.\r\n\r\nSecondly it reduces the costs associated with your future requirements. These are not limited to just the savings afforded against secure connectivity but the ability to expedite your time to market, to reach ecosystems as you need them and take services that become available with immediate effect.\r\n\r\nThirdly it provides a flexibility of choice and change against other connectivity requirements your organisation has. This means that you can still consume MPLS services, internet connected services or that which your organisation needs, but with the ability to have multiple providers that you can switch on or off as you need. This improves options for Business Continuity as well as protecting your business against large contractual tie-ins.\r\n\r\nFinally it provides an opportunity for revenue generation by collating considerable amounts of meta-data at a very granular level. In working with your Data Engineering Teams, we can help exploit the data in a way that allows your business to package and manipulate the data for new services or business efficiencies.",
